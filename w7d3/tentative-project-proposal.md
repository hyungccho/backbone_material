# Tentative Project Proposal

Before we ask you to pour your heart and soul into crafting a polished, thorough
blueprint for your final project, we want to be doubly sure that your core idea
is strong enough not only to stand on its own, but to really wow employers. To
facilitate this, we're requiring you to submit to us the basic premise (i.e.,
what app you plan to clone), as well as a bulleted list of the features you will
need to implement for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). You should think
carefully about this, but it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to finish your
outline. Again, the idea is not to sit down and plan everything out in minute
detail (there will be time for that later). We simply need to be able to screen
out projects that are too ambitious, not ambitious enough, or that wouldn't give
the best representation of your abilities.

## Choosing a Project
Before writing your proposal, you should figure out [which project you're going
to clone][clone-link]. You should think about the following:

* What features of this site am I going to clone? Are these features
  self-explanatory and easily demonstrated?
* Will these features show off everything I've learned in the course?

[clone-link]: ./projects-to-clone.md

When you're ready, go ahead and write out the features you'll need to implement.
Your finished product should look something like this:

## Project: Trello Clone
* Users can sign up and sign in
* Users can create and view boards
* Users can create lists, and lists are shown on their board
* Users can create cards, and cards are shown on their list
* Lists and cards are draggable
* Dragging lists and cards causes any changes in order to be saved to the
  database.

Send this to instructors-sf@appacademy.io or instructors-ny@appacademy.io by 9am
of W7D4. We will respond by the weekend to approve your outline or ask you to
amend it.
