## Choosing a Project

You **may not** clone an app that we have already partially cloned in
class. That would defeat part of the purpose of your capstone project,
which is to give you the experience of architecting and building an app
from the ground up. Projects that we have already cloned include
**Trello**, **Twitter**, **Reddit**, and an RSS feed reader app. You
should think about the following:

* What features of this site am I going to clone? Are these features
  self-explanatory and easily demonstrated?
* Will these features show off everything I've learned in the course?
