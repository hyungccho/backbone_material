#jQuery Plugin Demo

The actual code that adds a method to jQuery is found on 
lines 37-57 of the [`tabs.js`][tabs-js].

The jQuery plugin relies on a 'Tab' javascript class that 
interacts with a DOM element.  There is an example of how this 
would be used in the [`tabs.html`][tabs-html] file.

[tabs-js]: ./javascripts/tabs.js
[tabs-html]: ./tabs.html
